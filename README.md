# Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from:

* [David Nolen](https://github.com/swannodette) - who is an enthusiastic and friendly Clojure developer. 
He and his cohort, [Kovas Boguta](https://github.com/kovasb) created [The Immutable Stack](http://kitchentablecoders.com/class/2014/04/12/the-immutable-stack/).
* [Ruby On Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) - teaches us what to do (ease the transition to a new language and stack) and what not to do (railroad users into a brittle app framework which promotes low cohesion).
